summary: A minimalistic client accessing different websites, or web-APIs, and scraping them.

The tests included in the current version are:

* Google Pagespeed Insights API *(not working at the moment, to be updated to version 5)*
* Testing the 404 page and status code
* Validating the HTML code against W3C
* Validating the CSS code against W3C
* Users’ integrity test against Webbkoll, provided by Dataskydd.net

## psst. third party extensions...

## Get started with webperf_core

Here are some suggestions on how to get started with the tests on your own computer. Actually, it is even easier to run the tests on a cloud environment such as [PythonAnywhere - $ 5 / month](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=0007e5c6) - then the technical environment is ready to just upload the files.

You download the code itself from [GitHub - webperf_core](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core) and place it in a good location on your computer.
### Adjust the source code

There are two files that you need to adjust:

* *SAMPLE-config.py* needs to be renamed to *config.py*
The reason for this is because if you download a new version of the code, your settings or data should not be overwritten by accident.

Another thing you need to do is to open the *config.py* file and change one thing. The line that looks like the following is incomplete:  
*googlePageSpeedApiKey = “”*  
Between the quotation marks, enter your Google Pagespeed API key. See the following header for how to do this.

### Google Pagespeed API key

Google Pagespeed requires an API key. You can get one like this:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis).
2. Search for *Pagespeed Insights API*.
3. Click on *Credentials* (you may need to create a project first, if you do not already have one).
4. Click *+ Create Credentials*, then *API key*
5. In the dialog the key now appears below *Your API key*, it can look like this *AIzaXyCjEXTvAq7zAU_RV_vA7slvDO9p1weRfgW*

That code is your API key, that you should put in the *config.py* file in the source code, between the quotation marks on the line where you find *googlePageSpeedApiKey*.

## Running the code

You need to go through the following steps before you run the code:

1. If you do not have Python 3.8 or above installed, start with [downloading Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (which you can ignore if you run on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=0007e5c6)).
2. Open the Terminal (Macos & Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3. Navigate to where you downloaded (and unpacked) the source code. If you don’t know how to navigate in Terminal/CMD, read the [Windows guide](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) or [under Step 5 for Mac / Linux](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855).
4. Type the following command and hit Enter:  
*pip install -r requirements.txt*  
Then some Python extensions will be installed.
5. Start the program with the following command and press Enter:  
*python default.py -u https://webperf.se*

If that command results in errors, you can try addressing **Python3** instead:  
*python3 default.py -u https://webperf.se*

Now it will begin testing.

### Options and arguments

|Argument|What happens|
|---|---|
| -h/--help | Help information on how to use script |
| -u/--url <site url> | website url to test against |
| -t/--test <0/2/6/7/20> | runs ONE specific test against website(s) |
| -r/--review | show reviews in terminal |
| -i/--input <file path> | input file path (.json/.sqlite) |
| -o/--output <file path> | output file path (.json/.csv/.sql/.sqlite) |
| -a/--addUrl <site url> | website url (required in compination with -i/--input) |
| -d/--deleteUrl <site url> | website url (required in compination with -i/--input) |

For instance, if you'd like to to test *https://yourwebsite.com*, get the output as a JSON-file named *my-report.json* and also see the reviews in the prompt the statemant is as follows:  
*python default.py -u https://webperf.se -o my-report.json -r*

### Are you getting error messages?

It is often worthwhile to google the error messages you get. If you give up the search then you can always [check if someone on our Slack channel](https://webperf.se/articles/webperf-pa-slack/) have time to help you, but don’t forget to paste your error message directly in the first post. Or, if you think your error are common for more people than yourself, post an issue here at Github.

## Hosting webperf_core in the cloud

* [Get an account on PythonAnywhere and run the code in the cloud](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=0007e5c6) - through their “Tasks” function you can automatically run the code for example every day

Finally! Today, the first improved version of Webperf Core was released. The very first edition got published during the winter holiday and it had a couple of contingencies that were not really necessary. They were there because it inherited some things from [Webperf.se](//webperf.se) - the website.

[The current version is found at Github](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core). Now you can choose if you'd like your reports in the following formats:

* CSV (Comma-separated file)
* JSON
* SQL
* SQLite (the result will be input to a local SQLite database)
